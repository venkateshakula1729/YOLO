# YOLO
 This project will cover the basics of computer Vision, then dive into some classic computer vision algorithms and then finally will cover the modern Deep Learning approaches in CV. 

  The proposed project would roughly have the following structure:
  1. Introduction: an introduction of Computer Vision and some basic Linear Algebra and numpy required for the later parts of the project.
  2. Image processing: This portion will start with color spaces and conversions,Image Transformations(rotation, scaling, translation, etc.), then cover filters and kernels (noise removal, blurring, image thresholding) and finally conclude with hough transform, Edge detection(Canny Edge Detection) and contour detection algorithms(Watershed). Can also cover feature detection, depending upon the response.
  3. ML for Vision: Here, we'll deal with some basics of Deep Neural Networks and talk about convolutions(also covered in image processing part), various optimizers, backpropagation algorithm, Gradient Descent, SGD various Loss functions and their usages in CV context, Regularizations and Bias-Variance trade off.
  4. Applications: In this part we'll talk about some famous algorithms for some basic computer vision tasks.
        - Image Classification: Inception, VGG and Resnet.
        - Object detection: SSD, YOLO
        - Face Detection: HAAR cascades
